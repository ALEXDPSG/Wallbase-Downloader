<p>
	<a href="http://wallbase.cc" target="_blank">wallbase.cc</a> is an excellent site to download wallpapers with an option to search through the wallpapers database which are tagged.<br />
	But with literally a huge database it takes ages to download the wallpapers to browse and download.<br />
	So if you are in a hurry just use the wallbase script to leech the wallpapers of the site and then sort them at your leisure.<br />
